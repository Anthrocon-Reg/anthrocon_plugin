    <h2>{% if c.AFTER_DEALER_REG_DEADLINE %}You've been added to our waitlist!{% else %}Thanks for applying as a Dealer!{% endif %}</h2>

    We've received your application for {{ group.name }} to purchase a Dealer registration for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.

    <br/><br/>
    {% if c.AFTER_DEALER_REG_DEADLINE %}
        Since the Dealers Room is currently full, you've been added to our waitlist, and we'll let you know if a spot opens up for you.
    {% else %}
        We receive a flood of applications every year, which we respond to in the order in which we receive them.
        Approvals will be done as promptly as possible; usually within <strong>two weeks</strong> from application.
    {% endif %}

    <h3>What Happens Next</h3>
    After approval, you will be emailed a link to manage your dealer registration. From this link, you will be able to:
    <ul>
        <li>Pay for your dealer registration, which includes the cost of tables and Memberships.</li>
        <li>Register your Dealer Assistants.</li>
        <li>After your badge and table payment is received, you may add and pay for additional Dealer Assistants.</li>
        <li>If you have any questions, email us at dealers@anthrocon.org, or tweet us at @AC_Dealers_Room.</li>
    </ul>

    Your Dealership Payment includes your table cost and all Memberships in your group.  After payment, you'll be sent a link
    by email to follow if you wish to later upgrade your badge. Your Dealer Assistants will be able to upgrade their own
    Memberships and pay for those upgrades on their own.

    <br/><br/>Later, you will receive an additional email about your placement within the Dealers Room.

    <br/><br/>In the event we cannot accommodate your Dealership, you will receive an email.
