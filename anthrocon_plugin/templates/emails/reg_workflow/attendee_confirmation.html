{% if DONATIONS_ENABLED %}
    If you ordered bonus items such as a ribbon, t-shirt, or supporter package, you can pick those up at our merchandise booth.

    Your additional contribution of ${{ attendee.amount_extra }} provides you with these bonus items, which may be picked up at our merch booth:

    {% for swag in attendee.donation_swag %}
        <li>{{ swag }}</li>
    {% endfor %}

    {{ EVENT_NAME }} has a no-refund policy for all registrations.  If for any reason you can't make it, we allow and encourage
    you to resell your registration for the exact price you paid for it.  To transfer your registration to another person,
    send them <a href="{{ URL_BASE }}/preregistration/transfer_badge?id={{ attendee.id }}">this personalized link</a>,
    which will work until {{ UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime }}.
