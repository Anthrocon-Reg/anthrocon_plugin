{{ group.leader.first_name }}, 

I am sorry to inform you that only one space opened up for the waitlist, and unfortunately, your group ({{ group.name }}) did not make it into {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} Marketplace this year, which is why your application is now being declined.  Please try again next year.  Registration opens up at Otakon and online at the same time.  Again, I am very sorry that you did not make it into the Marketplace this year.
