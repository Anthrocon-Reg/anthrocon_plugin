Thanks for pre-registering for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.  Our records indicate that you are under the age of 18, and as such, you will need a signed parental consent waiver. If a parent/guardian will be present at {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, then they can sign the consent waiver when you pick up your badge at the registration desk. If a parent/guardian will not be at the event, the waiver may be brought pre-signed, however it MUST be notarized. We will not accept pre-signed waivers that are not notarized. You may find the waiver at {{ c.CONSENT_FORM_URL }}

If you are actually over 18, you can update your age in our database at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id  }} before {{ c.UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime }}.  Or you can simply ignore this email, since we'll be checking photo IDs at our registration desk.
