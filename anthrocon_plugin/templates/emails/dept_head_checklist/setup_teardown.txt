We're asking all Department Heads to tell us how much help they want before and after {{ EVENT_NAME }} with setup and teardown.  We have a couple of questions:

1) How many staffers would you like us to assign you to help with setup and teardown, if any?

2) Do you have any staffers already in mind to help you with this?  There are {{ attendee.assigned.0|setup_teardown_requests|length }} {{ attendee.assigned_display.0 }} staffers who have requested to help with setup/teardown.
{% for hr in attendee.assigned.0|setup_teardown_requests %}
- {{ hr.attendee.full_name }}{% if hr.approved %} (already approved){% endif %}{% endfor %}

You can let us know how many people you'd like, or you can do it directly at {{ URL_BASE }}/registration/hotel_requests

If we don't hear from you by the end of Friday, we'll assume you don't need any extra help and won't throw any extra staffers your way.
