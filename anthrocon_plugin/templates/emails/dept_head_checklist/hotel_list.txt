We're trying to finalize our hotel assignments this weekend.  Here's the list of staffers in your department who are currently signed up for hotel space, grouped by nights:
{% for nights, requests in attendee.assigned_depts|dept_hotel_nights %}
{{ nights }}{% for hr in requests %}
 - {{ hr.attendee.full_name }}{% if hr.not_yet_approved %}*{% endif %}{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
We in Stops are about to email everyone who offered to help with setup/teardown but was not approved (marked with a *) due to the overwhelming number of staffers who offered.  Let us know by the end of the weekend if there's someone we missed.
