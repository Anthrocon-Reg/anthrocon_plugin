Our records indicate that your group ({{ group.name }}) currently has some unassigned badges.  Although you can assign badges at our registration desk, this takes significantly longer than simply having everyone show up to pick up the badges which are already listed under their names.  Additionally, someone who is already registered by name with your group must be present whenever these unassigned badges are claimed.

If you already know who's coming with your group, we highly encourage you to use the following link to pre-assign your badges: {{ URL_BASE }}/preregistration/group_members?id={{ group.id }}

The latest that you can pre-assign your badges is {{ UBER_TAKEDOWN|datetime }}.
