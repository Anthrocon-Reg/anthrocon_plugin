{% if attendee.ribbon == c.DEPT_HEAD_RIBBON %}NOTE: This is an automated email, but even though you are a Department Head you should still pay attention to it, since you DO need to fill out the form linked below.

{% endif %}Thanks so much for helping run {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} last year, we couldn't have pulled it off without so much help from our wonderful volunteers.  As thanks for your help, you're eligible for a complementary Staff badge for the next {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}, which will be {{ c.EPOCH|datetime:"%b %e" }} - {{ c.ESCHATON|datetime:"%e" }}.  You can accept your badge by visiting {{ c.URL_BASE }}/preregistration/confirm?id={{ attendee.id }}

After you accept your Staff badge, you'll be emailed when next year's shifts become available.  Also, as a returning staffer, you'll also be eligible for complementary crash space in one of our staffer hotel rooms.  You'll be emailed closer to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} with details about how to sign up for this.

If you want to return to {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} but don't want to volunteer again, just let us know and we'll swap your Staff badge for a complementary Attendee badge as thanks for the hard work you put in last time.

Please let us know if you have any questions.
