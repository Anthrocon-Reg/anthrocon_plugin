You still haven't told us whether or not you want space in one of our volunteer hotel room at this year's {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.  If you accept, you'll be assigned to a hotel room with 3 - 4 other volunteers.  You can accept or decline this offer as part of our volunteer checklist at {{ c.URL_BASE }}/signups/login

If you don't sign up by {{ c.ROOM_DEADLINE|datetime }} then you will not receive hotel room space.

All volunteers who receive hotel room space must sign up for at least 30 weighted hours worth of shifts, but you won't be charged any money.  Volunteers who help with setup or teardown before or after {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} do not need to sign up for 30 weighted hours in advance, because so much of their work consists of be non-shift hours.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

{% if attendee.ribbon == c.DEPT_HEAD_RIBBON %}PS: Even though you're a department head, you still need to fill out the hotel form so that we know whether you want hotel room space, and you'll keep receiving these automated emails until you do!{% endif %}
